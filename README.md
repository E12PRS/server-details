## Resource Packs
I highly recommend picking out things you want from [VanillaTweaks](vanillatweaks.net/picker/resource-packs). This is what I am using as an example: [My Choices](https://vanillatweaks.net/share#qBMo0N) (you don't have to download it, just look at the choices). I am also using the Programmer Art resource pack included with the game as I like the older textures and a glass resource pack that makes the colours more vibrant. 

Make sure you enable the ItemSwapper mod resource pack. The Sorting mod and Voice Chat mod resource packs are optional.
